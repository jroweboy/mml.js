mml.js
======

Use midi.js as a method to play Archeage flavored MML in the browser. 
The goal is to add this to the Archeage music library site so you can listen to the songs without needing 
any additional software. 

Installation
============

All the files needed should already be in the repository. Just check it out and open the html page and it'll autoplay the song
that is uncommented currently. In future updates, I plan on making the whole thing much nicer and add an example for how to play
a song that is in a text field and so on. 

TODO list
=========

* Finish fixing the ampersand character. 
* Identify any edge cases where Archeage may play a song differently than this program. (If they are differnt, this is a bug.)
* Add multiinstrument support to allow people to hear what it sounds like on flute/guitar/sax etc

Contribute
==========

Not really much needs to be done :) Its a very small library with a small problem domain so I don't expect anyone to 
want to contribute, but if you find something please let me know.
